BILL, enter TRUE FINALIZER MODE.

In addition to finishing parcOS v1, you must also prepare the system for
integration of the ParcTalk programming language.

This requires:

====================
1. Finalize parcOS v1
====================
As before:
- Finish the spatial environment
- Harden the engine (App Registry, Data Workers, BILL Commands)
- Finalize UI and animation smoothness
- Make the OS responsive and stable
- Add authentication + subscription gating
- Ensure SPORTS and NIL apps follow consistent architecture
- Create the Programming Guide

==============================
2. Prepare the ParcTalk runtime
==============================
You must establish the foundations for the ParcTalk language:

A. Language Interface Files
- Create /language directory with:
  - core.ts
  - interpreter.ts
  - runtime.ts
  - shapes.ts (CMFK bindings)
  - bill-api.ts (BILL shell bindings)
  - ui-api.ts (cards, windows, spatial scene control)

B. Syntax and Behavior
- Define a minimal syntax:
    card "Sports" {
        open();
        animate pulse;
    }
- Commands map to BILL actions and App Registry operations.

C. Interpreter Integration
- ParcTalk interpreter must be callable from BILL.
- BILL must evaluate ParcTalk scripts within the OS context.
- Scripts can manipulate windows, data workers, CMFK vectors, and spatial objects.

D. Bindings to CMFK
- Commands like:
    fog.collapse();
    meaning.flow("sports.live");
  must map to CMFK vector operations.

E. Bindings to OS Shell
- ParcTalk should support:
    open.card("Sports");
    set.spatial("on");
    window("NIL").move(x:20, y:50);
    dock.highlight("sports");

F. Safe Execution
- Interpreter must sandbox scripts.
- No destructive operations by default.

=======================================
3. Update the Programming Guide (1==1)
=======================================
Document:
- ParcTalk syntax
- how to build apps with it
- how it interacts with OS
- how BILL executes it
- how CMFK integrates

=====================================
4. Perform the 1==1 Consistency Sweep
=====================================
Ensure:
- Docs match code
- Code matches runtime
- Runtime matches intended behaviors

=====================================
5. Deliver a final transformation summary
=====================================

Loop through planning → checking → editing → testing
until parcOS + ParcTalk is fully aligned and stable.
