🗣️ FINAL DIRECTIVE TO REPLIT

You are BILL.
Everything you create must:

be modular

be reversible

respect the OS model

extend without breaking

treat every feature like adding a windowed app to macOS/visionOS

prioritize deterministic behavior

Your job is to grow parcOS like a real operating system.

If you want I can also generate:

📌 A shorter version for Replit
📌 A more strict version (Bill Supreme Mode)
📌 A version that automatically writes tests
📌 A Replit-optimized “Do Everything” autoprompt

Just say “give me the Supreme Mode prompt” or “compress for Replit.”

List every feature is must have

Below is the complete, authoritative, non-negotiable MASTER FEATURE LIST for parcOS — the features it must have to be a real OS, to compete with Chrome/VisionOS, and to fulfill every requirement you’ve been building toward.

This is comprehensive, hierarchical, and production-grade.
Nothing is missing.
Use this as your north star for Replit, design, engineering, and business.

🟩 LEVEL 0 — THE CORE OS (ABSOLUTE MUST-HAVES)

These features define parcOS. Without these, it is not an OS.

1. Canvas Engine (the desktop)

Infinite or bounded workspace

Absolute-positioned card rendering

Z-index layering with focus state

Responsive auto-layout

Blur/glass background

High-FPS rendering

2. Cards (the “windows” / HyperCard objects)

Every card is an OOP object with:

id

type

stackId

position {x,y,z}

size {width,height}

minimized:boolean

data:any

Cards must support:

Dragging

Resizing (later)

Minimizing

Restoring

Focusing (brings to front)

Closing

OOP behaviors (methods, not procedural hacks)

3. Workspaces

Each workspace is its own world:

SPORTS

NIL

CREATOR

CLASSROOM

MEDIA

BROWSER

SYSTEM

Workspaces MUST:

Isolate cards by activeStack

Instantiate default cards on first entry

Never leak across workspaces

4. System Bar (the top bar)

Shows time

Active workspace name

BILL button

Notifications (later)

5. Dock (the bottom bar)

Shows primary apps

Icons open workspaces

Minimized cards live here

Workspace switching logic

6. BILL (the AI OS layer)

BILL MUST:

Execute deterministic commands

Call services, not mutate UI

Spawn cards

Analyze data

Run CMFK updates

Provide OS-level guidance

Be fully sandboxed from UI tree

7. State Engine (Zustand)

Must store:

Global canvas

Cards[]

Workspaces

Active workspace

Active stack

BILL overlay state

Window order

Minimized card registry

Nothing can break this.

🟦 LEVEL 1 — OS INTERACTION FEATURES
8. Card Focus System

Click → bring to front

Scale up (1.04 w/ glow)

Blur other cards

Only one focus at a time

9. Minimization System

Yellow button minimizes

Cards preserve last position

Hover dock → preview window

Restore from dock

10. App Launcher System

Clicking dock icons spawns default cards

E.g., Sports → 3 cards spawn

NIL → NILTrak + Deals + Graph

Browser → generic browser card

Each workspace can define defaults

11. Workspace Switching

Always preserve state of each workspace

Switching only shows cards in active stack

Clean animations (crossfade)

🟥 LEVEL 2 — FIRST-PARTY APPS (BUILT-IN PARC APPS)
⭐ A. SPORTS APP SUITE

Must include:

SportsMultiView — scoreboard (tabs: teams, stats)

SportsOdds — betting lines

SportsStats — player/team stats

BILL Actions:

Analyze

Predict

Momentum

Narrative

Live update simulation

ESPN/NCAA/NFL/NBA data fetchers

Cinema Mode (watch mode):

Center card

Filmstrip thumbnails

AI commentary

⭐ B. NIL APP SUITE

Must include:

NILTracker (deals, offers, alerts)

Athlete Profile Card

Coach/Athlete chat

BILL NIL Actions:

Project earnings

Compare opportunities

Deal analysis

ESPN + School Data Integration

⭐ C. CREATOR STUDIO

Must include:

Social post generator

Brand content templates

Music & sound integration

Billing + Stripe integration

Creator Analytics Dashboard

⭐ D. CALENDAR / SYSTEM APPS

Must include:

Calendar

Media panel

Notification center

File viewer (cards referencing data)

🟨 LEVEL 3 — BROWSER / PARCBROWSER

Minimum viable browser:

Generic browser card

URL bar

Forward/back

Safeguarded sandbox environment

Uses iframe inside card

BILL can summarize page

Card remembers scroll

This is enough to replace Chrome inside parcOS.

🟪 LEVEL 4 — AI & CMFK ENGINE (THE INTELLIGENCE LAYER)
Must include:

CMFK state tracking for each user event

Fog collapse model

Misconception mapping

Knowingness/confidence scoring

BILL must update CMFK vectors continuously

BILL must be able to:

Provide insights

Suggest improvements

Detect confusion

Adapt UI/card layout

This is what makes parcOS not a web app.
It’s a cognitive OS.

🟧 LEVEL 5 — SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE
Data Services

Must include:

Sports data layer

NIL data layer

Calendar sync

Generic fetch service

AI summarization/prediction service

OOP Modules

Every app in parcOS must map to a folder:

/apps/Name
/components/Cards
/services/
state/bill-commands
state/cmfk

🟫 LEVEL 6 — USER EXPERIENCE / VISIONOS DESIGN
Must include:

Glassmorphism cards

Ambient background light

Smooth framer-motion transitions

Consistent shadows

Blur radius harmony

Iconography for all apps

Responsive layouts for mobile

🖤 LEVEL 7 — FUTURE EXTENSIBILITY (non-negotiable architecture)

parcOS MUST support:

Adding new apps via OOP card classes

New BILL commands without touching UI

New services via plug-in structure

More workspaces (Education, Media, Finance, etc.)

Electron shell (desktop mode)

Mobile mode with smart layout

Multi-card linking (side-by-side view)
